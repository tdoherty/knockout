knockout
========

A demo I created at work, intended to pull data from an internal REST API. Demo uses Knockout.js and Require.js on the client,
and Node.js with express as a simple proxy to the API.

It's posted here only to illustrate coding style, the demo is API-specific and won't work without the API.
